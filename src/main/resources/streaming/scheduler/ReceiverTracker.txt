it tracks all receiver stream in streaming application.
it instance included in job scheduler and called in scheduler 's start method.




ReceiverTrackerActor get message from all receivers in workers.
and also send start / stop message to receiver.


#### most important method.
/**
     * Get the receivers from the ReceiverInputDStreams, distributes them to the
     * worker nodes as a parallel collection, and runs them.
     */
    private def startReceivers() {


#### how to start receiver on each worker
1. make a rdd with the partition number the same as receiver 's number
2. then create a function to start receiver
3. submit job set the rdd as data and function as functor.
actually the functor has nothing to do with data rdd.
