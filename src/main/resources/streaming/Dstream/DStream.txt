#### DStream
1. DStream include multiple RDD, each rdd for one interval, 1 or 2 seconds.

2. if you print the DStream, the implementation is actually to add a foreach
DStream as output stream into graph.
so that's why the print we define in the code not called repeated by framework.
spark just set the input output stream relation, then the job generator will
trigger new input/output in each interval.

3. there are two types of function can be applied to DStream.
a, just transform current DStream, then we got a new DStream.
then new one can be used, it is just middle result.
b, function applied to current DStream will generate

4. there is an important variable in DStream, remember duration.
that is the TTL for each RDD generated by DStream.
that's the DStream clean up mechanism.

5. window operation has two parameters, window length and slide duration.
if both equals, then there no overlap, no missing. otherwise, think.

6.


if you need accumulate the data generated in different time slot.
then the reduce window is method to do it.
it is a core method for DStream.
