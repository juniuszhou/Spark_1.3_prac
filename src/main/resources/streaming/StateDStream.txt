#### why state
state stream can keep some state about continuous stream.
for example, each word appeared how many times all in all.

the algorithm is simple, each state stream depends on its parent RDD,
which give the new data. and also depend on its previous state stream,
which record the all old state. so we can get new state stream via combine
its two parents.
