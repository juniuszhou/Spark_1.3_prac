   * Find more details at: http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-custom-receivers.html
   * @param receiver Custom implementation of Receiver
   */
  def receiverStream[T: ClassTag](
    receiver: Receiver[T]): ReceiverInputDStream[T] = {
    new PluggableInputDStream[T](this, receiver)
  }
