####  RDD[Edge[ED]]
it is the raw data type for edges. could build from file system directly.
for instance, the HDFS of hadoop or other distributed file system.

#### EdgeRDD
it is defined by graphX and a lot of optimization and extra info compare with RDD[Edge[ED]]

#### EdgeTriplet is sub class of EdgeRDD. which include the src and dst information.



####   ReplicatedVertexView
this class is exactly for Graph Impl 's data member.

which inherits from EdgeRDDImpl but it include two important
info about whether has src and dst information.

so when graph need compute triplet, graph need call its upgrade method to
get vertex info from vertexRDD.

class ReplicatedVertexView[VD: ClassTag, ED: ClassTag](
    var edges: EdgeRDDImpl[ED, VD],
    var hasSrcId: Boolean = false,
    var hasDstId: Boolean = false)


#### Questions ??????????????????
1. compute. the edge' compute must copy for its parent RDD.
   why need deep copy instead just get its reference.

2.
