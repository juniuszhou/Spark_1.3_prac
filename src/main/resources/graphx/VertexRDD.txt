#### vertex RDD
it is different with RDD[Vertex] that is raw data structure.
and VertexRDD including a lot of other information such as route table.

so if we create VertexRDD just from RDD[Vertex] some data member is empty.

when create vertex RDD. the duplicated value of a vertex can be removed arbitrarily
or you can set the merger function.






#### routing table.


#### ShippableVertexPartition has four major data members
val index: VertexIdToIndexMap,   the set of vertex id
val values: Array[VD],        the value of each vertex
val mask: BitSet,            which vertex id has corresponding value.
                    //it is very useful. sometimes, the vertex will be continuous computed may decrease.
                    //so we just need mask it in the bit set.
val routingTable: RoutingTablePartition)

#### RoutingTablePartition
// for each edge partition, there is a (Array[VertexId], BitSet, BitSet).
// for each vertex, two bits means if this vertex appeared in the edge partition
// as src vertex or as dst vertex.
routingTable: Array[(Array[VertexId], BitSet, BitSet)], for this Array, the partition id is index.
