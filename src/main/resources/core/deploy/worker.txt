#### worker
is an actor
can launch driver if yarn-cluster

find out shuffle service.
can has several executors



#### how worker get the jar and main/entry function
when task serialization, the jar also put into. and
worker can get it and run.  wrong wrong and wrong.

there is no necessary for worker to get all jar package.
worker just get the task including the function and the RDD
data and the bibao that's enough.
so in task runner there is a parameter named serializedTask: ByteBuffer.
and from deserialize, we can get running environment.

worker should get the whole jar of app. but when and how??
executor get message of launchTask from driver and then start the thread
to run.

Task include such method , serializeWithDependencies
