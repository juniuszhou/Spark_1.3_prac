#### difference between partition and partitioner.
RDD has several partitions does not mean the RDD include partitioner.

partitioner can put the data with the same key. or the same value into
the same partition via hashcode or range.

so that's different concept. partition is mandatory since we need parallel
computing. but partitioner not necessary, it depends on ops type.
