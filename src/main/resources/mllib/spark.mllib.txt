#### package ## class.

#### sub packer distributed.

block matrix , splitted via two dimension. RDD is a matrix
coordinate matrix, splitted via two dimension. but RDD for each pixel
indexed row matrix, splitted via column. RDD for row.
row matrix, splitted via column, RDD for vector but no index.

#### mllib.linalg

https://github.com/fommil/netlib-java location in github.
BLAS/LAPACK/ARPACK
BLAS basic linear algebra such as matrix multiply.
LAPACK give solution for problems like linear least squares, eigenvalue and SVD.
ARPACK lib implemented in fortran to solve large scale eigenvalue problems.


basic data structure
sparse vector
dense vector


## BLAS
def fromBreeze  we can see the index used breeze vertor may include some invalid indexes

## EigenValueDecomposition
get eigen via call ARPACK.

## matrices
define sparse and dense matrices. they are not distributed yet.


## vectors
vector / sparse vector / dense vector / also user can defined vector.
all those data structure is defined for spark. data structure use in different
blas lib should be transformed to those vectors.

for vector, its data stored in Array, so underlying data is immutable.
vector actually provide interface to update.


#### optimization

## GradientDescent
for compute gradient, it is a distributed computing depend on training data rdd
but for updater, it is a local computing. just happened in driver for a vector computing.


## Gradient
HingeGradient. the point within ( split line + 1 ) involving gradient descent.
LogisticGradient
LeastSquareGradient

## Updater
L1 updater and L2 updater depend on choose which one as regularization.






#### technology used
1. tree aggregate for compute mean of a matrix
2. transform data can be transformed to scale weights.
3.
